For matrix:
0 = unvisited grid
1 = visited grid of shortest path
2 = visited grid
9 = block grid found by agent
X = block grid in Maze not found by agent

For output numbers:
0 = up
1= down
2 = left
3 = right

we will input the output numbers into python and convert it to vectors:
For up =[1,0,0,0]
Down [0,1,0,0]
Left [0,0,1,0]
Right [0,0,0,1]
